This .epf (Eclipse Preferences File) changes C/C++ editor appearance to Vibrant Ink theme.
It does work with Eclipse and STM32CubeIDE.
Worth trying when eclipse color theme does not work (may happen in stm32cube ide).

How to apply:
Open Eclipse/STM32CubeIDE, File -> Import -> General -> Preferences and point to this file.

It only changes preferences regarding C/C++ editor appearance, nothing more.
