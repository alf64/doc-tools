The plug-in provides:

    Syntax highlighting for CMake defined variables, User defined Variables, Properties and Reserved Words
    Basic hover support to show brief description of command or variable being hovered over.
    Support for code templates to insert often used cmake code.
    Preference Panel to set custom syntax highlighting colors.
    Preference Panel to define custom code templates.
    Keystroke short cuts to comment/uncomment blocks of code.

    
Plugin adds new entry to Properties (see cmakeed-properties.png) where you can syntax highlighting colors.
You may need to tell which files shall be coloured by the plugin (.cmake files were not by default coloured!) - see cmakeed-files-association.png
