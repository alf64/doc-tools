##### Eclipse hints #####

##### Disable/enable newline addition by Eclipse when saving text file #####
Window -> Preferences -> C/C++ -> Editor -> Save Actions -> Ensure newline at the end of file


##### Preferred character encoding #####
UTF-8
If ANSI is needed, select UTF-8 as ANSI is a subset of UTF-8.


##### Changing language of Eclipse
By default eclipse may enable with language other than you prefer. There is no way to change it in eclipse menu.
You can change it through eclipse.ini file that's located in eclipse installation dir.

In my case the application was running in Polish and i wanted it to be in English
I fixed this problem by adding the following to eclipse.ini:
-nl
en

This must be added BEFORE '-vmargs' line and it's crucial to keep the newline (the can't be in the same line)

Eclipse must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

Another way of changing language could be: add the -Duser.language=en jvm argument AFTER the -vmargs parameter in the eclipse.ini file.
