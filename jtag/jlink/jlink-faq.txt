--------------------- Flashing target using JLink commander (JLink.exe) -------------------------

Jlink commander is part of JLink software installation (default installation dir for v8.58: C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLink_V858)
JLink commander is a command line tool that can be used to perform various things with the target through JTAG and SWD interface of connected J-Link debugger.

How to flash the target MCU with binary firmware file
1. Make sure you have the J-Link debugger connected and properly recognized by your operating system.
2. Open cmd.exe
3. In cmd.exe cd to location where JLink.exe is (i.e. C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLink_V858)
4. In cmd.exe call JLink.exe
You will now enter a session of JLink.exe in this cmd.exe
5. Execute command: connect
6. You'll be asked for device (target) name, input it and press enter. Example target name: EFM32GG390F1024
7. You'll be asked about interface to use (Jtag, Swd, Cjtag). Choose the one you prefer. I.e. to choose SWD input 'S' and press ENTER.
8. You'll be asked about interface clock speed (in khz). Default is 4000 khz. You can input your own or just press ENTER to keep the default.
9. From now on you can execute variosu commands that JLink commander offers.
The list of commands can be inspected by executing command: ?
10. Execute command: Erase
(the target memory will be erased)
11. Flash target with binary of your choice (firmware.bin) under specified address (0x0 in this case) by executing command:
LoadFile C:\Users\user1\firmware.bin 0
12. Verify if the target memory has been programmed successfully with specified binary file under given address (0x0 in this case) by executing command:
VerifyBin C:\Users\user1\firmware.bin 0
13. Finish the session with JLink commander by executing command: Exit
(After this command you will see that your target MCU is getting out of reset and your application starts)
