Qt Quick Designer (aka Qml Designer), is a simple plugin for QtCreator, meant for graphically editing .qml files. It will prepare the code automatically, based on your GUI design.
It is installed with QtCreator, but it is disabled by default, since Qt would prefer you to buy Qt Design Studio instead of using this simple plugin.

To enable it, open QtCreator and go to (@see plugins-window):
Help -> About Plugins -> Qt Quick -> QmlDesigner
You have to mark the checkbox to enable the QmlDesigner plugin. QtCreator will restart and now you will be able to hit the 'Design' button (on the left) whenever you have .qml file opened.
