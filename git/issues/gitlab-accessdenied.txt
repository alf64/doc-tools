ONLY FOR GITLAB REPOSITORIES: When gitbash throws HTTP Basic: Access Denied when you try to do any action in repo i.e. git clone, git pull:
1. Probably the credentials to your PC/Windows account has changed, and with this the password to gitlab changes (if gitlab associated with Windows)
2. In Windows find "credential manager" -> "Windows Credential".
3. Find saved credentials for gitlab and remove them.
4. Try to do any action in repository (i.e. git clone, git pull). You should be asked for your current Windows credentials. Fill them in and you should be fine.
