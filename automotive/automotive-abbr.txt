0-Series            = Null series. (a stage of the cars prototype production).



--- A ---
ASPICE              = Automotive SPICE
ASG                 = ASG = from German 'Anzeigesteuergerät' = which means 'display control unit'. A term used in BAP protocol to describe the device that can display information. Example devices: cluster, infotainment.
Apple CarPlay       = app built-in into the Infotainment. Made by Apple company. Allows you to connect your iPhone to the Infotainment and use some of the iPhone capabilities in your car (making phone calls, using your internet connection for navigation).
Android Auto        = app built-in into the Infotainment. Pretty much similiar to Apple CarPlay, but meant to be used specifically with Android phones.



--- B ---
* BP                = Base Pracitise
* BAP               = BAP = from German 'Bedien und AnzeigeProtokoll' = which means: 'control and display protocol'.
                    Protocol for communication between control unit (FSG) and display unit (ASG). Example: buttons on driving wheel to change radio stations are handled over BAP.
                    BAP physically is usually handled over CAN.



--- C ---
* CAN               = CAN = Controller Area Network - communication bus, a standard in automotive industry.
* Cluster           = a device that displays speed and other basic information for the driver.

--- E ---
* EOL               = End Of Line inspection
* EOL               = End of Life



--- F ---
* FSG               = FSG = from German 'FunktionsSteuerGerät' = which means: 'functional control unit'. A term used in BAP protocol to describe the device that has no display capabilities, but is used for controlling.
                    Example device: buttons on driving wheel.

--- H ---
* HUD               = HUD = Head Up Display. The device that displays information on windscreen.



--- I ---
* Infotainment      = the device at car's dashboard with LCD screen. Used for displaying information in a car (radio station, main menu, navigation).
* IC                = Instrument cluster (standard car's device that displays speed).



--- K ---
* KL15              = ignition switch position #2 (on)
* KL_30             = + connector (KLemmen) of the car's battery (typically 12VDC (or 24VDC) on this at all times)
* KL_31             = - connector (KLemmen) of the car's battery
* KL50              = is ignition position #3 (start)
* KLR               = means ignition switch position #1 (Accessory) In this mode the radio/IVI, windows, etc will be powered on, but the traction motor will not be enabled (ICE or EV), there may be limited HVAC (Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning) due to the HVAC compressor, and the heater not being powered.
* Kombi             = a cluster (standard car's device that display speed). This abbreviation is from German word: 'Kombiinstrument'.
* KPM               = Konzern Problem Management - management of the persisting issue (i.e. software bug).



--- L ---
* LHD               = LHD = Left Hand Drive = a car with the driving wheel on the left side. A standard in USA and most European countries.



--- M ---
* MIB               = probably a cluster (standard car's device that display speed)
* MMI               = Multi Media Interface = Audi name for Infotainment



--- P ---
* PVS               = Produktionsversuchsserie. (a stage of the cars prototype production). Meaning: Production test series.



--- Q ---



--- R ---
* RHD               = RHD = Right Hand Drive = a car with the driving wheel on the right side. A standard in United Kingdom.



--- T ---
* TEP               = TEchnical Process



--- U ---
* UML               = Unified Modelling Language



--- V ---
