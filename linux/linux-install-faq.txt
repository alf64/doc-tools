####################################################

1. When installing Linux (i.e. Ubuntu 24.04) on a computer that used to work in Legacy Boot Mode (MBR, MS-DOS)
it is recommended to switch to new standard UEFI mode that supports GPT (GUID Partition Table).
a) in device BIOS switch from Legacy Mode to UEFI mode
b) run ('try') Linux from bootable drive, when it boots do the following:
 - press Ctrl + Alt + T to open the terminal
 - run app that manages partitions: sudo gparted
 - gparted is a graphical app, so from now you navigate within its window
 - select the hard disk you are gonna format/prepare for Linux (i.e. '/dev/sda') - it's in the upper right corner of gparted window
 - see the existing partitions and delete all of them (rightclick -> delete). It may be required to click 'unmount' first for the 'delete' option to become visible
 - accept/execute the changes
 - Device -> Create Partition Table... -> gpt
 - create 8GB partition of ext4 type. Name it: boot_grub.
 - accept/execute the changes
 - right click on boot_grub partition -> Manage Flags. Set 'boot_grub' flag. This partition is going to be used by grub (boot manager)
 - create partition of ext4 type for the mounting point: /
 - create partition of ext4 type for the mounting point: /home
 - create partition of size the same as your RAM of ext4 type for the mounting point: swap
(swap means that this partition will be used by the system as RAM when needed, it's an optional partition)
 - accept/execute the changes
 - right click on boot_grub partition -> Manage Flags. Set 'swap' flag. This partition is going to be used by grub (boot manager)
c) install Linux (i.e. Ubuntu 24.04) and during installation set it to manually decide about partitions when asked
 - set mounting points / , /home and swap on partitons that you have created
 - leave boot_grub partition as it is, it should be automatically handled by the system
